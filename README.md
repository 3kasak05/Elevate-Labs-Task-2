# ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Overview:
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns and survival insights.  
We use **statistics and visualizations** to understand the data and prepare it for potential predictive modeling.

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Pandas** â†’ Data handling & summary statistics  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â†’ Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps  
- **Plotly** â†’ Interactive visualizations  

##  What We Did
1. **Data Import** â€“ Loaded Titanic dataset (CSV).  
2. **Summary Statistics** â€“ Mean, median, std, min/max for numeric features.  
3. **Visualizations** â€“  
   - Histograms & Boxplots (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch)  
   - Correlation Heatmap & Pairplot  
   - Survival analysis by **Gender, Passenger Class, Family Size**  
4. **Interactive Plotly Chart** â€“ Age distribution by survival.  
5. **Insights & Inferences** â€“ Key patterns & anomalies identified.  

##  Key Insights
- **Females had much higher survival (~75%)**.  
-  **1st class passengers** survived the most, 3rd class the least.  
-  **Higher fares â†’ better survival chances**.  
-  **Children survived more often** than middle-aged men.  
-  **Small families survived better** than solo or very large families.  

##  Why This Matters
- Helps beginners **learn EDA techniques** step by step.  
- Builds intuition for **feature selection** before ML modeling.  
- Can be extended into a **survival prediction project**.  

##  How to Run
1. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Upload your `titanic.csv` file.  
3. Run the notebook cells to explore data & generate insights.  

**This project is a great starting point for **data science learners** to practice statistics, visualizations, and storytelling with data.
